# QScreenCast
A no-nonsense [screen-caster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast) behind a [QToolButton](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtoolbutton.html). More info can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/nerohmot/QScreenCast/wiki).

This implementation is a fist (granted a bit naive)

We are gearing up to make a second iteration, this time by using [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) under the hood!
